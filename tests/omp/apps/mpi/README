This directory contains examples of how one can MPI parallelize programs 
that have complex dependencies and are close to production applications.

The examples are:

1. 2D Finite Difference Method
2. Finite Element Method
3. LU Factorization
4. SOR Method
5. Monte Carlo Method
6. Molecular Dynamics
7. MPMD Models
